JavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`, and `cancelIdleCallback`, along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. FakeTimers also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.

In addition in browser environment `@sinonjs/fake-timers` provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments FakeTimers provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.

`@sinonjs/fake-timers` can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other
situations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to actually
wait.

`@sinonjs/fake-timers` is extracted from [Sinon.JS](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon.js) and targets the [same runtimes](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/#suppo
